# YourBlog MERN Stack Project

This is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), **Redux**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The application provides a modern and responsive user interface along with a robust backend.

## Features

- **MERN Stack**: Seamless integration between MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
- **Redux**: Centralized state management for efficient and scalable data handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for fast and customizable UI design.
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication and authorization features (if applicable).
- **CRUD Operations**: Basic functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and sessions (if applicable)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use a cloud MongoDB instance like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/HongNT03/your-blog.git
cd your-blog
```

### 2. Install dependencies

First, navigate to the **backend** folder and install the server-side dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Next, navigate to the **frontend** folder and install the client-side dependencies:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

#### Backend
Create a `.env` file in the **server** folder and add the following environment variables (replace values as necessary):

```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

#### Frontend
For the frontend, if you're using environment variables (e.g., for API URLs), create a `.env` file in the **client** folder:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_fire_base_key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
```

### 4. Run the application

To start both the backend and frontend concurrently:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the **server** folder. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In another terminal, navigate to the **client** folder and run the React app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Account Admin to view all functionality of apllication
   ```
   Username: Admin@gmail.com
   Password: Admin@gmail.com
   ```
The app should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) for the frontend, and the backend will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Folder Structure

```
/server
  /models        # MongoDB models
  /routes        # Express routes
  /controllers   # Route handlers
  /middleware    # Middleware functions
  .env           # Environment variables

/client
  /src
    /components  # React components
    /redux       # Redux store and slices
    /styles      # TailwindCSS customizations (if any)
    App.js       # Main React app
    index.js     # React entry point
  .env           # Frontend environment variables
```

## Usage

- Use **Redux** for managing global state across your React components.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling. If you need to customize Tailwind, you can modify the `tailwind.config.js` file in the client folder.
- Backend API routes are located in the **/server/routes** folder.
- You can extend the backend to include authentication, CRUD functionality, or other features based on your needs.
